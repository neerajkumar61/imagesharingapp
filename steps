This folder contains zipped file first unzip it to the directory you want and and then follow the below given steps for full setup on your machine.

For installing this application one must follow these steps

1. First go to directory and run Bundle Install .

gems used are twitter-bootstrap-rails,devise, carrierwave,mysql2,will_paginate etc.

This application basically deals with Image uploading to an album where user can upload maximum 25 photos in an album(here I had made it to 2 for testing purpose). If album has more than 2 images it wont show the photo adding form.

Here user can edit his/her albums and photos but can only see other users images and albums.

user can search albums by their name(extra)

Pagination is also there 2 albums per page(for testing purpose)

Sign in / sign up functionalities.

I have used bootstrap to many places but not totally implemented as it was told to me functionality is important not UI.


Thanks for reading this.
